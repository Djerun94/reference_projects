Customer Segmentation
This project uses clustering algorithms to segment customers of a wholesale distributor based on their purchasing behavior. The dataset used in this project is the Wholesale customers dataset, which contains the annual spending on various product categories for customers of a wholesale distributor.

The project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:

pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git
Replace <username> with your GitHub username and <repository-name> with the name of your repository.

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd <repository-name>
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the cust_seg_kmeans.py script to perform customer segmentation using K-means clustering:

Copy code
python cust_seg_kmeans.py
This will generate a pairplot of the clustered data and print the mean values for each cluster.
